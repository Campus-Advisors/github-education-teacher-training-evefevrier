For the Module 1.2 Assignment, you will open up your command line and complete the following:

- [X] Create a directory using the command `mkdir`
- [X] In the directory you created initialize Git using `git init`
- [X] Create a README.md file in your directory using the `touch` command
- [X] Make sure README.md is in your _Working Directory_ by checking your status with `git status`
- [X] Move README.md from the _Working Directory_ to the _Staging Area_ by using `git add`
- [X] Make sure README.md is in your _Staging Area_ by checking your status with `git status`
- [X] Commit README.md to your repository using `git commit`
- [X] Make sure your _Working Directory_ and _Staging Area_ are clean with `git status`
- [X] Make sure your commit has been logged into your repository by using `git log`

Once you have completed these steps, take a screenshot of your command line, with the steps above, and upload your screenshot to a new `Issue` titled `Module 1.2 Assignment`. I have added the screenshot from the Module 1.1 Assignment for reference.

In the body of the issue you can drag and drop your screenshot or search for it on your device. Once you have added the screenshot you can submit the issue and move to the next lesson.
